This is multired-0.1.


This is a Python implmementation of the algorithm for structural
reduction of multi-layer networks based on the Von Neumann Entropy 
and on the Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence of graphs, as explained 
in:

  M. De Domenico. V. Nicosia, A. Arenas, V. Latora
  "Structural reducibility of multilayer networks", 
  Nat. Commun. 6, 6864 (2015) doi:10.1038/ncomms7864

If you happen to find any use of this code please do not forget to
cite that paper ;-)

My plan is to provide also a C version in the future, but I cannot 
guarantee that I will do so anytime soon.
